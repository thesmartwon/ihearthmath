I want to use machine learning to find optimal decks and play strategies.

dependencies
===========
I'm using (fireplace)[https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace] and (tensorflow)[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow] on (Python 3.5+.)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]
Install python, and then fireplace and tensorflow preferably using virtual environments. Once you can `import fireplace` and `import tensorflow`, you are ready to go.
